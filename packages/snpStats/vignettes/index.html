<h2>snpStats: Overview </h2>
This package extends the <tt>snpMatrix</tt> package, allowing uncertainty
in genotype assignments, for example as  consequence of imputation.
It provides most of the functionality of <tt>snpMatrix</tt>, although
a few functions differ somewhat from their predecessors.  It also
provides several new functions. 

Classes have had to be renamed but are mostly compatible with those
in  <tt>snpMatrix</tt>, and functions are included to convert these to
their <tt>snpStats</tt> equivalents. However, the  imputation rules objects in
<tt>snpMatrix</tt> are not compatible with those now used and must be 
regenerated.

For more details, see the "differences" vignette.

Further development of the <tt>snpMatrix</tt> project by this developer will
take place entirely within <tt>snpStats</tt>.
